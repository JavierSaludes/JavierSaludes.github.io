	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>
	Hello, I am a freelance Graphic Designer and aspiring web developer. My work includes several projects related to information design, product design, logo design, photograph restoration, illustration, typography, and large format printing. 
	<p>
	Recent jobs completed include a large-scale information panel currently on display at Clovis Botanical Garden (see Photoshop section), a graphic poster for the Fresno County Master Gardeners Landscape Tree Care Committee promoting proper tree pruning, and multiple photograph restoration projects.
	<p>
	Additionally, I recently completed two website development courses at <a href="http://geekwiseacademy.com/about">Geekwise Academy</a>, a division of Bitwise Industries that provides accelerated training programs aimed at teaching in-demand skills required in the tech industry. Course work included website development training related to HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Javascript, Responsive markup, Photoshop, frameworks and other developer tools.
	<p>
	I specialize in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Acrobat, and other software. I am proficient on MAC and PC.
	</p>
