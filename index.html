	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>
	Hello, my name is Javier Saludes and I am freelance Graphic Designer and aspiring web developer. My work includes several projects related to 3D design, 2D Design, Illustration, typography, information design, product design, logo design, photograph restoration, and large format printing. 
	<p>
	Recent jobs completed include a large-scale information panel currently on display at Clovis Botanical Garden, a graphic poster for the Fresno County Master Gardeners Landscape Tree Care Committee promoting proper tree pruning, and multiple photograph restoration projects.
	<p>
	Additionally, In May of 2014, I completed my second course at Geekwise Academy, a division of Bitwise Industries that provides accelerated training programs aimed at teaching in-demand skills required in the tech industry. Course work included website development training related to HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Javascript, Responsive markup, Photoshop, frameworks and other developer tools. This website was created using techniques I learned in the Boot Camp II course.
	<p>
	I specialize in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Acrobat, and other software. I am proficient on MAC and PC.
